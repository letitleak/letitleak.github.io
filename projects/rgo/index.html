                    <p><strong>This is a work-in-progress.</strong></p>

<p>My new project, <a href="https://github.com/yberreby/rgo"><code>rgo</code></a>, is a Go compiler
toolchain, written in <a href="http://rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>. It&rsquo;s not finished yet, but
it&rsquo;s basically going to be a program that can compile Go code down to machine
code, as well as a library that can be used to parse Go code, among other
things.</p>

<p>I started writing <code>rgo</code> because I had a goal: learning how to write a
fully-fledged compiler for a programming language that people actuall use. Not a
toy language, because, although that would have been much simpler, it would also
be a much less rewarding and interesting experience.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to write a compiler or an interpreter - <em>something</em> that
takes code and turns it into something runnable. Lisp has been reimplemented
again and again, and was too simple. C compilers are also commonplace, AND the
language has its share of warts.</p>

<p>So I chose to write a compiler for Go. I dislike many of the language&rsquo;s design
choices, but it seemed like a good fit. To the best of my knowledge, there is no
reimplementation of the Go compiler, whether in Rust or in another language, so
I decided to write one.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s an additional challenge: I know very, very little Go, so I&rsquo;m learning
the language along the way. As of writing, I&rsquo;ve only written a few hundred lines
of Go - although I found two bugs in the viper package:
<a href="https://github.com/spf13/viper/issues/174">#174</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/spf13/viper/issues/175">#175</a>.</p>

<p>My main reference material is the <a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec">Go
Specification</a> to look up the syntax of various
constructs and translating that into a bunch of Rust structs and enums. This is
somewhat tedious, but I&rsquo;m learning a few things about Go&rsquo;s syntax along the way.</p>
